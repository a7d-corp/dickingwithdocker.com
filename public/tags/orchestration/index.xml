      <description>A solution in need of a problem Like all good sysadmins, my personal website has been a &amp;lsquo;coming soon&amp;rsquo; splash page for quite some time. According to the Wayback Machine, it&amp;rsquo;s been this way since some time in 2014. As I&amp;rsquo;m sure many can sympathise with, there are always far more interesting and shiny things to be experimenting with than building a website.
One of the interesting things I like to experiment with is Kubernetes (as should be apparent from the tag cloud).</description>

      <description>All the choices So you&amp;rsquo;re looking to start using Kubernetes, but you&amp;rsquo;re overwhelmed by the multitude of deployment options available? Judging by the length of the Picking the Right Solution section to the Kubernetes docs, it&amp;rsquo;s safe to assume that you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. Even after you&amp;rsquo;ve made it past the provisioning stage, you then need to learn how to administrate what is a very complex system. In short; Kubernetes is not easy.</description>

      <title>Forcing Kubernetes to use a secondary interface</title>

      <description>Following on from my previous post, I discovered rather to my dismay that although I had my nodes initially communicating over the secondary interface, the weave services (and thus my inter-pod traffic) was all going over the public interface.
As these are VPSes, they have a public IP on eth0 and a VLAN IP on eth1, so it makes sense for all inter-pod traffic to stay internal. If I check the logs for one of the weave-net containers, we can see all comms are going via the 1.</description>

      <description>With the 1.4 release of Kubernetes, Google have made instantiating a cluster a whole lot easier. Using Kubeadm, you can bring up a cluster with a single command on each node. A further command will create a DaemonSet which brings up a Weave mesh network between all your nodes.
As always with complex systems such as Kubernetes, there are some potential pitfalls to be aware of. Firstly, the getting started guide notes that v1.</description>
