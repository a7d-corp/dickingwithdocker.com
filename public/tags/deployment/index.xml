      <description>A solution in need of a problem Like all good sysadmins, my personal website has been a &amp;lsquo;coming soon&amp;rsquo; splash page for quite some time. According to the Wayback Machine, it&amp;rsquo;s been this way since some time in 2014. As I&amp;rsquo;m sure many can sympathise with, there are always far more interesting and shiny things to be experimenting with than building a website.
One of the interesting things I like to experiment with is Kubernetes (as should be apparent from the tag cloud).</description>

      <description>All the choices So you&amp;rsquo;re looking to start using Kubernetes, but you&amp;rsquo;re overwhelmed by the multitude of deployment options available? Judging by the length of the Picking the Right Solution section to the Kubernetes docs, it&amp;rsquo;s safe to assume that you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. Even after you&amp;rsquo;ve made it past the provisioning stage, you then need to learn how to administrate what is a very complex system. In short; Kubernetes is not easy.</description>
