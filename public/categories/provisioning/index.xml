      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been experimenting with Hashicorp&amp;rsquo;s Consul in my home infrastructure because I want to use it to provide service discovery and automatic DNS provisioning when I create Proxmox instances with Terraform. Consul is a bit of a hefty beast to get to grips with and getting DNS lookups working when you have ACLs enabled can be a little tricky - it&amp;rsquo;s taken me a day or two of going round in circles to figure this one out.</description>

      <title>Terraform S3 remote state with Minio and Docker</title>

      <description>Storing Terraform&amp;rsquo;s remote state in Minio Whilst AWS&amp;rsquo;s free S3 tier is almost certainly sufficient to store Terraform&amp;rsquo;s remote state, it may be the case that you have a requirement to keep the data on-site, or alternatively if you&amp;rsquo;re using Terraform in an air-gapped environment then you have no choice but to self-host.
Enter Minio. If you&amp;rsquo;ve not used it before, the TLDR is that Minio provides an S3-compatible API in a single binary.</description>

      <description>A solution in need of a problem Like all good sysadmins, my personal website has been a &amp;lsquo;coming soon&amp;rsquo; splash page for quite some time. According to the Wayback Machine, it&amp;rsquo;s been this way since some time in 2014. As I&amp;rsquo;m sure many can sympathise with, there are always far more interesting and shiny things to be experimenting with than building a website.
One of the interesting things I like to experiment with is Kubernetes (as should be apparent from the tag cloud).</description>
