      <description>This blog is going to be about using Hashicorp&amp;rsquo;s Vault to issue short-lived certificates to use with SSH. Most guides have you using a username &amp;amp; password to authenticate with Vault, but I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen to delegate that to GitHub instead.
I&amp;rsquo;m assuming you already have a Vault server running - I won&amp;rsquo;t be covering that in the course of this blog. You&amp;rsquo;ll also need a sufficiently-privileged Vault token, and jq installed on the machine you wish to SSH from.</description>
