      <description>Lessons I learnt whilst developing modules Having now spent quite some time working on my initial Ansible modules for Memset, I&amp;rsquo;ve assembled some handy hints on areas which tripped me up at various times in my journey.
It should be noted that this post is written from the point of view of someone who is not a developer and is therefore not as au fait with some of the processes mentioned as others may be.</description>
